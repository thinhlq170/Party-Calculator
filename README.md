# Party-Calculator
- This project is from my friend's idea. We had a party and everyone must remember all groceries were bought, it was very difficult to calculate money when every person comes up with plenty of items.
- Built with Java, SQLite.
- Calculates average amount have to be paid for members join party and note lists of parties, members and items were bought.
